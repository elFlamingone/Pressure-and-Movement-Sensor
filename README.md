# Pressure-and-Movement-Sensor
This is the first prototype of an aquatic sensor collecting movement and pressure data for underwater research purposes

in this project you'll get some ideas of incorporating a pressure Sensor with IMU and GPS.
The software will collect data at 2 Hz on an arduino based microcontroller (TEENSY 3.5)
Ther will be a GPS Tag at the beginnig of sampling and after the System is put out of water.

I recommend using the 3" pressure enclosoure from BlueRobotics
